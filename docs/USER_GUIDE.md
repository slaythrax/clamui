# ClamUI User Guide

Welcome to ClamUI! This guide will help you get the most out of your antivirus protection on Linux.

## What is ClamUI?

ClamUI is a user-friendly desktop application that brings the powerful ClamAV antivirus engine to your Linux desktop with an intuitive graphical interface. No command-line knowledge required!

Whether you're downloading files, managing USB drives, or just want peace of mind about your system's security, ClamUI makes virus scanning simple and accessible.

## Who is this guide for?
