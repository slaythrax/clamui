## Getting Started

### Launching ClamUI

After installing ClamUI using your preferred method, you can launch it in several ways:

**From your Application Menu:**
- Look for "ClamUI" in your desktop's application launcher
- On GNOME, press the Super key and type "ClamUI"
- The application appears with a shield icon

**From the Terminal:**

If you installed via Flatpak:
```bash
flatpak run com.github.rooki.ClamUI
```

If you installed via .deb package or from source:
```bash
clamui
```

**With Files to Scan:**

You can also launch ClamUI with files or folders to scan immediately:

```bash
# Flatpak
flatpak run com.github.rooki.ClamUI /path/to/file /path/to/folder

# Native installation
clamui /path/to/file /path/to/folder
```

When launched with file arguments, ClamUI will open with those paths pre-loaded in the scan view.

### First-Time Setup

When you first launch ClamUI, the application will:

1. **Check for ClamAV Installation**
   - ClamUI requires ClamAV (the antivirus engine) to be installed on your system
   - If ClamAV is not found, you'll see a warning message with installation instructions
   - See the [Troubleshooting](#clamav-not-found) section if you encounter this issue

2. **Create Default Scan Profiles**
   - ClamUI automatically creates three useful scan profiles:
     - **Quick Scan**: Scans common locations like Downloads, Desktop, and Documents
     - **Full Scan**: Comprehensive scan of your entire home directory
     - **Home Folder**: Scans your home directory with common exclusions
   - You can customize these or create your own profiles later

3. **Set Up Configuration Directories**
   - Settings are saved to `~/.config/clamui/`
   - Scan logs and quarantine data are stored in `~/.local/share/clamui/`
   - These directories are created automatically

**Updating Virus Definitions**

Before your first scan, it's important to ensure your virus definitions are up to date:

1. Click the **Update Database** button (cloud icon with arrow) in the header bar
2. Click the "Update Now" button in the Update view
3. Wait for the update to complete (this may take a few minutes on first run)
4. You'll see a success message when definitions are current

💡 **Tip**: ClamUI can check for database updates automatically. See [Database Update Settings](#database-update-settings) to enable auto-updates.

### Understanding the Main Window

ClamUI uses a clean, modern interface that follows GNOME design guidelines. Here's what you'll see when you open the application:

![Main Window](../screenshots/main_view.png)

**Header Bar (Top)**

The header bar contains your main navigation and controls:

- **ClamUI Title**: Shows the application name
- **Navigation Buttons** (left side): Six icon buttons to switch between views:
  - 📁 **Scan Files**: Main scanning interface (default view)
  - ☁️ **Update Database**: Update virus definitions
  - 📄 **View Logs**: Browse scan history
  - ⚙️ **ClamAV Components**: Check ClamAV installation status
  - 🛡️ **Quarantine**: Manage isolated threats
  - 📊 **Statistics**: View protection statistics and scan activity
- **Menu Button** (right side): Access Preferences, About, and Quit

**Content Area (Center)**

The main content area displays the currently selected view. Each view has its own purpose:

- **Scan View**: Select files/folders to scan, configure scan options, and view results

- **Statistics View**: See charts and metrics about your scanning activity

**Status Information**

At the bottom of most views, you'll find:
- ClamAV version information
- Database status (last updated date and number of signatures)
- Quick status indicators

### Navigating Between Views

Switching between different parts of ClamUI is simple and intuitive.

**Using the Navigation Buttons**

The six buttons in the header bar let you quickly jump to any view:

1. Click any navigation button to switch to that view
2. The active view's button will be highlighted (pressed in)
3. The content area updates immediately to show the selected view

**Keyboard Shortcuts**

ClamUI supports keyboard shortcuts for faster navigation:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit ClamUI |
| `Ctrl+,` | Open Preferences |

💡 **Tip**: More keyboard shortcuts for specific actions are available in each view.

**View-Specific Navigation**

Some views have additional navigation within them:

- **Scan View**: Switch between "Quick Actions" using scan profiles
- **Logs View**: Filter and search through scan history
- **Statistics View**: Change timeframe filters (7 days, 30 days, all time)

**Returning to the Scan View**

Click the folder icon (📁) button in the header bar at any time to return to the main scanning interface.

### Your First Scan

Ready to scan for viruses? This walkthrough will guide you through running your very first scan with ClamUI. We'll show you how to select what to scan, understand what's happening during the scan, and interpret the results.

#### Selecting Files and Folders

ClamUI gives you several ways to choose what to scan. Pick the method that works best for you:

**Method 1: Using the Browse Button**

This is the most straightforward approach:

1. Look for the **Scan Target** section in the main view
2. Click the **Browse** button on the right side of the "Selected Path" row
3. A file picker dialog will appear
4. Navigate to the folder or file you want to scan
5. Click **Select** to confirm your choice
6. The selected path will appear in the "Selected Path" subtitle

💡 **What should I scan first?** Start with your Downloads folder - it's where files from the internet arrive and is most likely to contain threats.

**Method 2: Drag and Drop**

For quick scanning, you can simply drag files or folders into ClamUI:

1. Open your file manager (Files, Nautilus, etc.)
2. Locate the file or folder you want to scan
3. Drag it into the ClamUI window
4. Drop it anywhere in the scan view
5. The path will be automatically selected

**Visual Feedback**: When dragging over ClamUI, you'll see a highlighted border indicating it's ready to accept your files.

**Method 3: Using Scan Profiles** (Recommended for beginners)

Scan profiles are pre-configured scan targets that make scanning even easier:

1. Look for the **Scan Profile** section at the top
2. Click the dropdown menu (it says "No Profile (Manual)" by default)
3. Choose one of the default profiles:
   - **Quick Scan**: Scans common locations (Downloads, Desktop, Documents)
   - **Full Scan**: Comprehensive scan of your entire home directory
   - **Home Folder**: Scans your home directory with common exclusions
4. The scan target will be automatically set when you select a profile

💡 **Tip**: For your first scan, try "Quick Scan" - it's fast and covers the most important areas.

**Method 4: Command-Line Arguments** (Advanced)

If you're comfortable with the terminal, you can launch ClamUI with a path already selected:

```bash
# Flatpak
flatpak run com.github.rooki.ClamUI ~/Downloads

# Native installation
clamui ~/Downloads
```

This method is great for integrating ClamUI with other tools or file managers.

#### Understanding Scan Progress

Once you've selected what to scan, you're ready to start. Here's what to expect:

**Starting the Scan**

1. Click the **Scan** button (the big blue button in the middle)
2. You'll immediately see changes in the interface:
   - The Scan button becomes disabled (grayed out)
   - The Browse button and Profile dropdown are also disabled
   - A "Scanning..." message appears at the bottom
   - The entire interface becomes non-interactive to prevent conflicts

**During the Scan**

While ClamUI is scanning:

- **Be patient**: Scanning can take time, especially for large folders or if you have many files
- **Don't close the window**: Closing ClamUI will stop the scan in progress
- **Watch the status**: The status message at the bottom will show "Scanning..." until complete
- **System usage**: You may notice increased CPU usage - this is normal as ClamAV analyzes files

**How long will it take?**

Scan duration depends on:
- **Number of files**: More files = longer scan time
- **File sizes**: Large files take longer to analyze
- **Scan backend**: Daemon (clamd) is faster than standalone clamscan
- **System resources**: Faster CPU = faster scanning

Typical scan times:
- Downloads folder (100-500 files): 10-30 seconds
- Home directory (10,000+ files): 2-10 minutes
- Full system scan: 15-60+ minutes

💡 **Tip**: While your first scan runs, feel free to read ahead in this guide to learn about other features!

**Scan Completion**

When the scan finishes:
- All buttons become active again
- The status message updates with results
- If threats were found, they appear in the "Scan Results" section below
- If no threats were found, you'll see a success message

#### Interpreting Scan Results

After your scan completes, ClamUI displays clear, easy-to-understand results. Let's break down what you'll see:

![Scan Results Example](../screenshots/main_view_with_scan_result.png)

**Clean Scan (No Threats Found)**

If your files are clean, you'll see:

```
✓ Scan complete: No threats found (XXX files scanned)
```

This green success message means:
- All scanned files are safe
- No viruses, trojans, or malware were detected
- You can continue using your files normally

The number in parentheses shows how many files were examined.

**Threats Detected**

If ClamUI finds threats, you'll see:

```
⚠ Scan complete: X threat(s) found
```

This red warning message is followed by a detailed list of each threat found. Don't panic - ClamUI gives you all the information and tools you need to handle threats safely.

**Understanding Threat Details**

Each detected threat is displayed in a card showing:

1. **Threat Name** (large text at the top)
   - The technical name of the virus or malware
   - Example: "Eicar-Signature", "Win.Test.EICAR_HDB-1"
   - This name is used by antivirus databases worldwide

2. **Severity Badge** (colored label on the right)
   - **CRITICAL** (red): Dangerous malware, immediate action required
   - **HIGH** (orange): Serious threats, should be quarantined
   - **MEDIUM** (yellow): Moderate concern, investigate further
   - **LOW** (blue): Minor issues or test files

3. **File Path** (monospaced text, second line)
   - The exact location of the infected file
   - You can select and copy this text
   - Example: `/home/username/Downloads/suspicious_file.exe`

4. **Category** (if available)
   - The type of threat detected
   - Examples: "Trojan", "Test", "Malware", "PUA" (Potentially Unwanted Application)

5. **Action Buttons** (bottom of each card)
   - **Quarantine**: Safely isolates the threat file
   - **Copy Path**: Copies the file path to your clipboard

**What Should I Do With Detected Threats?**

Here's your action plan:

1. **Don't panic** - ClamUI has already identified the threat and prevented any harm
2. **Review the threat details** - Check the file path to understand what was flagged
3. **Click "Quarantine"** - This safely moves the file to isolation where it can't cause harm
4. **Verify it's not a false positive** - Sometimes legitimate files are mistakenly flagged (see FAQ)

**For most users**: Click "Quarantine" on any detected threats. You can always restore files later if needed.

**Testing With EICAR**

Not sure if ClamUI is working correctly? Use the built-in test feature:

1. Click the **Test (EICAR)** button next to the Scan button
2. ClamUI creates a harmless test file that all antivirus software recognizes
3. The scan runs automatically and should find the test "threat"
4. You'll see a detection for "Eicar-Signature" or similar
5. This confirms ClamUI is working properly

**Important**: EICAR is NOT real malware - it's an industry-standard test pattern that's completely safe. It exists only to test antivirus software.

**Understanding Large Result Sets**

If a scan finds many threats (50+), ClamUI uses smart pagination:

- Only the first 25 threats are shown initially
- A **"Show More"** button appears at the bottom
- Click it to load 25 more threats at a time
- This keeps the interface responsive even with hundreds of detections

**Next Steps After Your First Scan**

Congratulations on completing your first scan! Now you can:

- **Explore scan profiles** - Try the Quick Scan, Full Scan, or Home Folder profiles
- **Set up scheduled scans** - Automate scanning to run regularly
- **Check the quarantine** - Review what's been isolated
- **View scan history** - See all your past scans in the Logs view
- **Customize settings** - Configure ClamUI to match your preferences

## Scanning for Viruses

Now that you've completed your first scan, let's dive deeper into ClamUI's scanning capabilities. This section provides comprehensive reference information about all scanning features.

### File and Folder Scanning

ClamUI provides flexible options for selecting files and folders to scan. Understanding these options helps you scan exactly what you need, when you need it.

#### Understanding Scan Targets

A **scan target** is the file or folder you want ClamUI to check for viruses. You can scan:

- **Individual files**: Any single file on your system (useful for checking downloads)
- **Folders/directories**: Entire folders and all their contents (recursive scanning)
- **Multiple locations**: Using scan profiles, you can scan multiple folders at once
- **External drives**: USB sticks, external hard drives, network locations (if accessible)

**Important**: ClamUI scans recursively by default. When you select a folder, all files and subfolders inside it are scanned automatically.

#### Selecting Files to Scan

**Using the File Picker (Browse Button)**

The Browse button opens a standard GTK file picker dialog:

1. Click **Browse** in the "Scan Target" section
2. The dialog opens to your home directory by default
3. Navigate using:
   - **Folder list** (left sidebar): Jump to common locations
   - **Path bar** (top): Click any folder in the current path
   - **Search** (Ctrl+F): Find files/folders by name
4. To select a file:
   - Click on the file name
   - Click **Select** in the bottom-right corner
5. To select a folder:
   - Navigate into the folder you want to scan
   - Click **Select** in the bottom-right corner (folder itself is selected)
   - Or click the folder once and then click **Select** to scan it

**Tips for File Selection**:
- You can only select one path at a time using the Browse button
- To scan multiple locations, use scan profiles instead
- The file picker respects hidden files based on your file manager settings
- You can type a path directly in the location bar (Ctrl+L)

#### Path Display and Validation

Once you select a path, ClamUI displays it in the "Selected Path" row:

```
Selected Path: /home/username/Downloads
```

The path is validated automatically:
- ✅ **Valid paths** display normally in monospaced font
- ❌ **Invalid paths** show an error banner with details
- 🔒 **Permission issues** are detected before scanning starts

**Common path validation errors**:
- Path does not exist (file/folder was deleted or moved)
- Insufficient permissions to read the location
- Path is on a remote filesystem that's not mounted
- Special system paths that require root access

If you see a validation error, choose a different path or check the file permissions.

### Drag-and-Drop Scanning

Drag-and-drop provides the fastest way to scan files in ClamUI. Simply grab a file or folder from your file manager and drop it into the ClamUI window.

#### How Drag-and-Drop Works

**Visual Feedback**

When you drag files over the ClamUI window:

1. **Drag starts**: Pick up a file/folder in your file manager
2. **Drag over ClamUI**: The entire window highlights with a colored border
3. **Border style**: Dashed blue/accent color border appears
4. **Background tint**: Light transparent overlay shows the drop is accepted
5. **Drop the file**: Release your mouse button anywhere in the window
6. **Border disappears**: Visual feedback clears immediately
7. **Path updates**: The dropped path appears in "Selected Path"

This visual feedback confirms ClamUI is ready to accept your file.

#### Drag-and-Drop Behavior

**What you can drop**:
- ✅ Files from your local filesystem
- ✅ Folders/directories
- ✅ Multiple files (first valid file is used)
- ✅ Files from archive managers (if they provide local paths)

**What won't work**:
- ❌ Remote files (http://, ftp://, etc.) - must be downloaded first
- ❌ Files from cloud storage (unless locally synced)
- ❌ Dropping during an active scan (rejected with error message)
- ❌ Special URIs that don't resolve to local paths

**Multi-file drops**: If you drop multiple files, ClamUI uses the first valid file path and ignores the rest. To scan multiple locations, use scan profiles instead.

#### Drop Error Handling

If a drag-and-drop operation fails, ClamUI displays an error banner explaining why:

- **"Scan in progress"**: You can't change the scan target while scanning
- **"No files were dropped"**: The drag operation didn't contain valid file data
- **"Remote files not supported"**: The file is not on your local filesystem
- **"Path does not exist"**: The file was moved or deleted during the drag
- **"Permission denied"**: You don't have read access to the dropped file

These error banners can be dismissed by clicking the "×" button or automatically disappear after a few seconds.

### Testing with the EICAR Test File

The **EICAR test file** is a special tool for verifying that antivirus software is working correctly. ClamUI includes a convenient "Test (EICAR)" button for instant testing.

#### What is EICAR?

EICAR (European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research) created a standard test file that **all antivirus software recognizes as a threat**, but which is **completely harmless**.

**Important facts about EICAR**:
- ✅ It's NOT real malware - it cannot harm your computer
- ✅ It's just a specific text string that antivirus programs look for
- ✅ It's used worldwide to test antivirus installations
- ✅ It's safe to create, download, and delete
- ❌ It won't do anything malicious (it's not even executable code)

The EICAR string looks like this:
```
X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*
```

When ClamAV scans this string, it detects it as a threat with names like:
- `Eicar-Signature`
- `Eicar-Test-Signature`
- `Win.Test.EICAR_HDB-1`

#### Using the EICAR Test Button

ClamUI makes EICAR testing simple with a dedicated test button:

**Step-by-Step**:

1. **Find the Test button**: Located next to the main Scan button in the scan view
2. **Click "Test (EICAR)"**: The button is styled with a beaker icon (🧪)
3. **Automatic test file creation**: ClamUI creates a temporary EICAR file
4. **Scan starts immediately**: No need to select a path
5. **Wait for results**: Scanning completes in 1-2 seconds
6. **Review detection**: You should see the EICAR threat detected
7. **Automatic cleanup**: The test file is deleted after scanning

**Expected Results**:

✅ **Working correctly**: ClamUI shows a threat detection with:
- Threat name containing "EICAR" or "Eicar-Signature"
- Severity level: **LOW** (blue badge)
- Category: **Test**
- File path: Temporary directory path

❌ **Not working**: If no threat is detected:
- ClamAV may not be properly installed
- Virus definitions may be outdated
- Scan backend might have issues
- See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for solutions

#### When to Use EICAR Testing

**Use the EICAR test when**:
- You just installed ClamUI and want to verify it works
- You updated virus definitions and want to confirm they loaded
- You suspect ClamUI isn't detecting threats correctly
- You're demonstrating ClamUI to someone
- You changed scan backend settings and want to test

**How often to test**: Testing once after installation is usually sufficient. You don't need to test regularly unless you suspect problems.

### Understanding Scan Progress

When you click the Scan button, ClamUI performs several operations behind the scenes. Understanding what's happening helps you interpret scan behavior and diagnose issues.

#### The Scanning Lifecycle

**1. Scan Initialization (< 1 second)**

When you click Scan:
- UI elements become disabled (buttons grayed out)
- Visual indication shows scanning is in progress
- ClamUI validates your scan target path one final time
- Settings are read (exclusion patterns, scan backend choice)
- The scanner is configured with your chosen options

**2. Backend Selection**

ClamUI chooses which scanning method to use:

- **Auto mode** (default):
  - First, try to connect to clamd daemon
  - If daemon is running: Use daemon for faster scanning
  - If daemon is unavailable: Fall back to clamscan
- **Daemon mode**: Use clamd only (error if unavailable)
- **Clamscan mode**: Use standalone clamscan only

**Backend performance**:
- **clamd (daemon)**: Fast (10-50x faster), lower CPU usage, requires running daemon
- **clamscan (standalone)**: Slower, higher CPU usage, always available

💡 **Tip**: Check which backend is being used in Statistics → Components view

**3. Scanning Process**

ClamAV analyzes files looking for malware signatures:

- Files are read from disk sequentially
- Each file is checked against the virus definition database
- Suspicious patterns trigger detections
- Results are collected as scanning progresses
- Exclusion patterns (if configured) skip matched files

**What ClamAV checks**:
- File contents (signature matching)
- File headers and structure
- Embedded scripts and macros
- Archive contents (zip, tar, rar, etc.)
- Email attachments and formats
- Compressed and encoded data

**System impact during scanning**:
- **CPU usage**: 20-80% of one CPU core (varies by backend)
- **Disk I/O**: Reading files from disk (SSD is faster than HDD)
- **Memory**: Typically 50-200 MB (higher for large archives)
- **Other apps**: Should remain responsive during scanning

**4. Scan Completion**

When scanning finishes:
- Results are parsed from ClamAV output
- Threat details are extracted and classified
- Severity levels are assigned to detected threats
- Scan log is saved to history
- UI updates with results
- Buttons become active again

**Exit codes** (technical reference):
- `0` = Clean (no threats found)
- `1` = Infected (threats detected)
- `2` = Error (scanning failed)

#### Scan Duration Estimates

How long a scan takes depends on several factors:

**File count**: More files = longer scan time
- 100 files: ~10-30 seconds
- 1,000 files: ~1-3 minutes
- 10,000 files: ~5-15 minutes
- 100,000+ files: ~30-120 minutes

**File sizes**: Large files take longer to scan
- Small text files: Milliseconds per file
- Large documents (PDFs, Office files): 1-5 seconds each
- Videos and archives: 5-30 seconds each
- ISO images and disk images: Minutes per file

**File types**: Different formats have different scan complexity
- ⚡ Fast: Plain text, small binaries
- 🐌 Slow: Archives (zip, tar.gz), large PDFs, disk images

**Scan backend**:
- clamd (daemon): Up to 50x faster
- clamscan (standalone): Slower but always available

**Storage speed**:
- SSD: 2-5x faster than HDD
- Network drives: Much slower (depends on network speed)
- USB 2.0: Slower than internal drives
- USB 3.0/3.1: Similar to internal HDDs

**Example scan times** (typical modern system with SSD):

| Location | File Count | Backend | Duration |
|----------|------------|---------|----------|
| Downloads folder | 200 files | daemon | 10-20s |
| Downloads folder | 200 files | clamscan | 30-60s |
| Home directory | 15,000 files | daemon | 3-8 min |
| Home directory | 15,000 files | clamscan | 10-20 min |
| Full system | 500,000+ files | daemon | 30-90 min |

💡 **Tip**: For faster scans, enable the clamd daemon in Preferences → Scan Backend

#### Monitoring Scan Progress

**What you can see during scanning**:
- Status message: "Scanning..." appears at the bottom
- UI state: All controls disabled while scanning
- Window title: May show scanning indicator (depends on desktop environment)

**What you can't see** (current limitation):
- Real-time file count or progress percentage
- Current file being scanned
- Estimated time remaining

**Why there's no progress bar**: ClamAV doesn't report real-time progress when scanning. ClamUI only receives results when the scan completes.

**What you can do during scanning**:
- ✅ Leave the window open (don't minimize or close)
- ✅ Read other parts of this guide
- ✅ Use other applications
- ❌ Don't close ClamUI window (stops the scan)
- ❌ Don't put your computer to sleep
- ❌ Don't unmount the drive being scanned

### Reading Scan Results

After a scan completes, ClamUI presents results in a clear, structured format. This section explains how to read and understand every detail.

#### Result Status Messages

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Card Components Explained**:

**1. Threat Name** (top, large bold text)
- The technical name from ClamAV's virus database
- Format varies: `Platform.Type.Variant-ID`
- Examples:
  - `Win.Trojan.Generic-12345` (Windows trojan)
  - `Eicar-Test-Signature` (EICAR test)
  - `PUA.Linux.Miner.Generic` (potentially unwanted app)
- This name is recognized globally across all antivirus software

**2. Severity Badge** (top-right, colored label)
- Visual indicator of threat danger level
- Four levels: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- Color-coded for quick recognition
- See [Threat Severity Levels](#threat-severity-levels) for details

**3. File Path** (second line, monospaced)
- Absolute path to the infected file
- You can select this text and copy it
- Format: `/full/path/to/infected/file.ext`
- Use this to locate the file in your file manager

**4. Category** (third line, if available)
- The type of malware or threat
- Common categories:
  - **Virus**: Traditional computer viruses
  - **Trojan**: Trojan horse malware
  - **Worm**: Self-replicating worms
  - **Ransomware**: File-encrypting ransomware
  - **Adware**: Advertising software
  - **PUA**: Potentially Unwanted Application
  - **Test**: Test signatures (like EICAR)
  - **Spyware**: Information-stealing software
  - **Rootkit**: System-hiding malware
  - **Backdoor**: Remote access tools
  - **Exploit**: Vulnerability exploits
  - **Macro**: Macro viruses (documents)
  - **Phishing**: Phishing attempts
  - **Heuristic**: Behavior-based detection

**5. Action Buttons** (bottom)
- **Quarantine**: Safely isolate the threat file
  - Moves file to secure quarantine storage
  - File can't execute or spread from quarantine
  - You can restore it later if it's a false positive
  - See [Quarantine Management](#quarantine-management) for details
- **Copy Path**: Copy file path to clipboard
  - Useful for reporting or manual investigation
  - You can paste the path into a terminal or file manager
  - Helps you locate the file without typing the full path

#### Understanding File Counts

At the end of a scan, ClamUI reports:

```
No threats found (1,543 files scanned)
```

**What "files scanned" means**:
- Individual files examined by ClamAV
- Includes files in subdirectories (recursive count)
- Does NOT include:
  - Directories themselves (only files within)
  - Excluded files (via exclusion patterns)
  - Files ClamAV couldn't read (permission denied)
  - Symbolic links (unless they point to files)

**Why the count might seem low**:
- Hidden files might not be counted
- Some files might be skipped due to exclusions
- Symlinks to outside the scan path are ignored
- Empty directories contain zero files

**Why the count might seem high**:
- Archives are unpacked and contents are counted individually
- Cache files and temp files are included
- Each file in nested folders is counted

### Threat Severity Levels

ClamUI automatically classifies detected threats into four severity levels. Understanding these levels helps you prioritize your response to detections.

#### How Severity is Determined

ClamUI analyzes the threat name from ClamAV and matches it against known patterns to determine severity. This classification is based on:

- **Threat type keywords**: Ransomware, Trojan, Adware, etc.
- **Malware capabilities**: What the threat can do
- **Potential damage**: How dangerous the threat is
- **Industry standards**: Common classification practices

**Classification is automatic**: You don't need to understand threat names yourself - ClamUI does the analysis for you.

#### The Four Severity Levels

**🔴 CRITICAL (Red Badge)**

The most dangerous threats requiring immediate action.

**Threat types**:
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts your files and demands payment
  - Examples: `Ransom.Locky`, `CryptoLocker`, `WannaCry`
- **Rootkits**: Hides malware presence and provides deep system access
  - Examples: `Rootkit.Win32`, `Bootkit.Generic`
- **Bootkits**: Infects boot process for persistence
  - Examples: `Bootkit.MBR`, `Rootkit.Boot`

**What they can do**:
- Encrypt all your personal files
- Hide themselves from antivirus software
- Survive system restarts
- Provide attackers with complete system control
- Steal credentials and sensitive data

**Recommended action**:
1. **Quarantine immediately** - Don't delay
2. **Scan other systems** - Check if it spread
3. **Change passwords** - If the system was compromised
4. **Consider professional help** - For business/critical systems

**🟠 HIGH (Orange Badge)**

Serious threats that should be quarantined promptly.

**Threat types**:
- **Trojans**: Disguised malware that performs malicious actions
  - Examples: `Win.Trojan.Agent`, `Trojan.Generic`
- **Worms**: Self-replicating malware that spreads automatically
  - Examples: `Worm.Win32`, `Worm.AutoRun`
- **Backdoors**: Provides remote access to attackers
  - Examples: `Backdoor.Linux.Generic`, `RAT.Win32`
- **Exploits**: Takes advantage of software vulnerabilities
  - Examples: `Exploit.CVE-2021-12345`, `Exploit.PDF`
- **Downloaders/Droppers**: Downloads additional malware
  - Examples: `Downloader.Generic`, `Dropper.Win32`
- **Keyloggers**: Records keyboard input to steal credentials
  - Examples: `Keylogger.Win32`, `Spyware.KeyLog`

**What they can do**:
- Steal passwords and personal information
- Download more malware to your system
- Give hackers remote control of your computer
- Spread to other computers on your network
- Monitor your activities and communications

**Recommended action**:
1. **Quarantine the file** - Isolate the threat
2. **Run a full system scan** - Check for related infections
3. **Review recent downloads** - Identify the source
4. **Update software** - Patch exploited vulnerabilities

**🟡 MEDIUM (Yellow Badge)**

Concerning threats that warrant investigation.

**Threat types**:
- **Adware**: Displays unwanted advertisements
  - Examples: `Adware.Generic`, `PUA.Adware.Win32`
- **PUA/PUP**: Potentially Unwanted Applications/Programs
  - Examples: `PUA.Win.Generic`, `PUP.Optional.Toolbar`
- **Spyware**: Monitors activities and collects information
  - Examples: `Spyware.Win32`, `Monitor.Generic`
- **Miners**: Uses your computer to mine cryptocurrency
  - Examples: `CoinMiner.Win32`, `Miner.Linux`
- **Unknown threats**: Threats not matching specific patterns
  - Examples: `Generic.Suspicious`, `Unknown.Malware`

**What they can do**:
- Slow down your computer (especially miners)
- Display annoying ads and pop-ups
- Track your browsing habits
- Modify browser settings and search engines
- Consume resources for cryptocurrency mining
- Collect data for marketing purposes

**Recommended action**:
1. **Review the file** - Is it something you intentionally installed?
2. **Check if it's a false positive** - See [FAQ](#faq)
3. **Quarantine if unsure** - Better safe than sorry
4. **Uninstall related software** - Remove the source application

**🔵 LOW (Blue Badge)**

Minor issues and test files that pose little to no real danger.

**Threat types**:
- **EICAR test signatures**: Industry-standard antivirus test files
  - Examples: `Eicar-Signature`, `Test.File.EICAR`
- **Heuristic detections**: Behavior-based suspicious patterns
  - Examples: `Heuristic.Generic`, `Suspicious.Behavior`
- **Generic detections**: Very broad pattern matches
  - Examples: `Generic.Low`, `Possible.Threat`
- **Test files**: Created intentionally for testing
  - Examples: `Test-Signature`, `Sample.Test`

**What they are**:
- Harmless test files (EICAR)
- Files that "look suspicious" but may be safe
- Overly broad matches that catch legitimate software
- Test malware samples (if you're a security researcher)

**Recommended action**:
1. **Don't panic** - These are usually safe
2. **Verify the file purpose** - Why do you have this file?
3. **For EICAR**: This confirms your antivirus works - you can delete it
4. **For heuristics**: Check if it's a known program
5. **Quarantine if unknown** - Or delete if it's just a test file

#### Severity Classification Examples

Here are real-world examples showing how ClamUI classifies different threat names:

| Threat Name | Severity | Category | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| `Ransom.WannaCry` | CRITICAL | Ransomware | Ransomware = critical |
| `Win.Rootkit.Generic` | CRITICAL | Rootkit | Rootkit = critical |
| `Trojan.Agent.Win32` | HIGH | Trojan | Trojan = high |
| `Worm.AutoRun.VBS` | HIGH | Worm | Worm = high |
| `Backdoor.Linux.Generic` | HIGH | Backdoor | Backdoor = high |
| `Exploit.CVE-2021-1234` | HIGH | Exploit | Exploit = high |
| `PUA.Win.Adware.Generic` | MEDIUM | Adware | Adware = medium |
| `Spyware.KeyLogger` | HIGH | Spyware | Keylogger = high |
| `CoinMiner.Linux.XMRig` | MEDIUM | Miner | Miner = medium |
| `Eicar-Test-Signature` | LOW | Test | EICAR = low |
| `Heuristic.Suspicious` | LOW | Heuristic | Heuristic = low |

#### Severity Limitations and False Positives

**Important notes about severity classification**:

- ⚠️ **Severity is based on the threat name only**: ClamUI can't analyze the actual malware behavior
- ⚠️ **New threats**: Very new malware might get generic names and lower severity ratings
- ⚠️ **False positives**: Legitimate software can be flagged incorrectly
- ⚠️ **Platform matters**: A Windows virus on Linux can't execute (but should still be removed)

**When severity might be misleading**:
- Generic detections: `Generic.Trojan` might be critical or might be benign
- Test files: Security researchers might have high-severity test samples that are safely contained
- Cross-platform threats: Windows malware on Linux isn't immediately dangerous but should be quarantined

**Always use your judgment**: Severity is a guide, not a definitive risk assessment. When in doubt, quarantine the file and research the threat name online.

## Scan Profiles

Scan profiles are pre-configured scan settings that save you time and make scanning more convenient. Instead of manually selecting folders and configuring options every time you scan, profiles let you save your preferred scanning setups and launch them with a single click.

### What are Scan Profiles?

A **scan profile** is a saved configuration that contains:

- **Target directories/files**: What to scan (e.g., Downloads, Home folder, entire system)
- **Exclusion rules**: What to skip (specific paths or file patterns)
- **Profile metadata**: Name, description, creation date

**Why use profiles?**

✅ **Save time**: Launch common scans instantly without browsing for folders
✅ **Consistency**: Ensure you scan the same locations every time
✅ **Convenience**: Create specialized profiles for different purposes
✅ **Efficiency**: Skip irrelevant files automatically with exclusions

**Common use cases**:
- Quick check of downloaded files
- Weekly scan of your home directory
- Full system scan with common exclusions (system folders, caches)
- Scan external USB drives with specific exclusion patterns

### Using Default Profiles

ClamUI includes three built-in profiles that cover the most common scanning needs. These profiles are created automatically when you first launch ClamUI.

#### Quick Scan

**Purpose**: Fast scan of commonly infected locations

**What it scans**:
- `~/Downloads` - Your Downloads folder

**Exclusions**: None

**When to use**:
- After downloading files from the internet
- Quick daily security check
- Testing suspicious downloads
- When you want fast results (typically 10-30 seconds)

**How to use**:
1. Click the **Scan Profile** dropdown in the scan view
2. Select **Quick Scan**
3. Click the **Scan** button
4. Wait for results

💡 **Tip**: Quick Scan is perfect for beginners or as a daily habit. It focuses on your Downloads folder where most threats enter your system.

#### Full Scan

**Purpose**: Comprehensive system-wide security check

**What it scans**:
- `/` - The entire root filesystem (all directories and files)

**Exclusions**:
The following system directories are excluded for performance and to avoid false positives:
- `/proc` - Kernel process information (virtual filesystem)
- `/sys` - Kernel system information (virtual filesystem)
- `/dev` - Device files (not regular files)
- `/run` - Runtime data (temporary)
- `/tmp` - Temporary files
- `/var/cache` - Application caches
- `/var/tmp` - More temporary files

**When to use**:
- Monthly or quarterly comprehensive scan
- After suspecting a system compromise
- Before important backups
- When you have time for a thorough check (30-90+ minutes)

**How to use**:
1. Ensure you have time available (this can take 30-90+ minutes)
2. Select **Full Scan** from the Scan Profile dropdown
3. Click **Scan**
4. Let it run in the background

⚠️ **Important**: Full Scan examines hundreds of thousands of files and can take a significant amount of time. It's best run when you don't need your computer for other tasks, or schedule it to run automatically (see [Scheduled Scans](#scheduled-scans)).

#### Home Folder Scan

**Purpose**: Balanced scan of your personal files

**What it scans**:
- `~` - Your entire home directory (includes Documents, Pictures, Videos, Downloads, Desktop, etc.)

**Exclusions**:
- `~/.cache` - Application cache files (typically safe)
- `~/.local/share/Trash` - Your trash folder (files you've deleted)

**When to use**:
- Weekly personal files security check
- Before backing up your home directory
- After installing new software
- When you want thorough coverage without scanning system files (10-30 minutes)

**How to use**:
1. Select **Home Folder** from the Scan Profile dropdown
2. Click **Scan**
3. Review results when complete

💡 **Tip**: Home Folder is a good middle ground between Quick Scan (fast but limited) and Full Scan (thorough but slow). It covers all your personal data while excluding common cache locations.

### Creating Custom Profiles

While the default profiles cover most needs, you can create custom profiles for specific purposes like scanning USB drives, project folders, or specialized directories.

#### How to Create a Profile

**Step-by-Step**:

1. **Open the Profile Manager**:
   - Click the **hamburger menu** (three horizontal lines) in the header bar
   - Select **Manage Profiles** from the menu

2. **Click "New Profile"**:
   - Look for the **+** button or **New Profile** button
   - A dialog window will appear

3. **Fill in Basic Information**:
   - **Name** (required): Give your profile a descriptive name
     - Maximum 50 characters
     - Must be unique (no duplicate names)
     - Examples: "USB Drives", "Project Files", "Work Documents"
   - **Description** (optional): Explain what this profile is for
     - Helpful reminder of the profile's purpose
     - Example: "Scans all USB drives connected to /media"

4. **Add Target Directories**:
   - Click the **Add Target** button
   - Browse to the folder you want to scan, or type the path
   - Repeat to add multiple locations
   - **Tips**:
     - Use `~` to represent your home directory (e.g., `~/Projects`)
     - You can add both files and folders
     - Each target is scanned recursively (includes all subfolders)

5. **Add Exclusions** (optional):
   - **By Path**: Exclude specific directories
     - Click **Add Exclusion Path**
     - Browse to or enter the path to exclude
     - Example: `~/Projects/node_modules` (skip npm packages)
   - **By Pattern**: Exclude files matching patterns
     - Click **Add Exclusion Pattern**
     - Enter a glob pattern (e.g., `*.tmp`, `*.log`)
     - Example: `*.iso` (skip large disk images)

6. **Save the Profile**:
   - Click the **Save** button
   - Your new profile appears in the Scan Profile dropdown immediately

**Example Custom Profiles**:

**USB Drive Scanner**:
- Name: "External Drives"
- Targets: `/media`, `/mnt`
- Exclusions: `*.mp4`, `*.mkv` (skip video files for speed)
- Purpose: Quickly scan USB sticks and external hard drives

**Development Projects**:
- Name: "Code Projects"
- Targets: `~/Projects`, `~/workspace`
- Exclusions: `*/node_modules`, `*/.git`, `*/build`, `*/dist`
- Purpose: Scan source code while skipping dependencies and build artifacts

**Important Documents**:
- Name: "Documents Only"
- Targets: `~/Documents`, `~/Desktop`
- Exclusions: None
- Purpose: Focused scan of your important work files

#### Profile Creation Tips

💡 **Best Practices**:

- **Descriptive names**: Use clear names that explain what the profile scans
- **Start simple**: Create basic profiles first, add complexity as needed
- **Test your profile**: Run it once to ensure it scans what you expect
- **Exclude wisely**: Skip large files/folders that are unlikely to contain threats
- **Use ~ for home paths**: Makes profiles portable across systems

⚠️ **Common Mistakes to Avoid**:

- **Don't exclude everything**: If your exclusions cover all targets, the scan will find nothing
- **Watch name length**: Profile names are limited to 50 characters
- **Verify paths exist**: While non-existent paths are allowed, they won't be scanned
- **Don't scan virtual filesystems**: Skip `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev` (these aren't real files)

### Editing Existing Profiles

You can modify any profile you've created (default profiles cannot be edited, but you can duplicate them).

#### How to Edit a Profile

**Step-by-Step**:

1. **Open the Profile Manager**:
   - Click the **hamburger menu** in the header bar
   - Select **Manage Profiles**

2. **Select the Profile to Edit**:
   - Find the profile in the list
   - Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) next to it

3. **Modify Settings**:
   - Change the name, description, targets, or exclusions
   - Add or remove target directories
   - Add or remove exclusion rules
   - All fields work the same as when creating a profile

4. **Save Changes**:
   - Click **Save** to apply your changes
   - Click **Cancel** to discard changes

**What you can edit**:
- ✅ Profile name (must remain unique)
- ✅ Description
- ✅ Target directories (add/remove)
- ✅ Exclusion paths and patterns (add/remove)

**What you cannot edit**:
- ❌ Profile ID (internal identifier)
- ❌ Creation date
- ❌ Default profile flag (default profiles cannot be edited)

**Editing Default Profiles**:

Default profiles (Quick Scan, Full Scan, Home Folder) are **protected from editing** to ensure they remain available with their standard configurations.

**To customize a default profile**:
1. **Export** the default profile (see [Importing and Exporting](#importing-and-exporting-profiles))
2. **Import** it (this creates a copy with a new name like "Quick Scan (2)")
3. **Edit** the imported copy with your customizations

This way, you keep the original default profile and have your customized version.

### Managing Exclusions

Exclusions let you skip files and folders during scanning, improving performance and reducing false positives.

#### Why Use Exclusions?

**Performance reasons**:
- Skip large files that are unlikely to contain threats (videos, disk images)
- Avoid scanning build artifacts and dependencies (node_modules, .git)
- Exclude temporary files and caches

**Reduce false positives**:
- Development tools sometimes flag legitimate software as "PUA" (Potentially Unwanted Application)
- Test files and security tools might trigger detections

**Privacy and system stability**:
- Skip trash folders (files you've already deleted)
- Avoid virtual filesystems that can cause errors (`/proc`, `/sys`)

#### Types of Exclusions

**1. Path Exclusions** (Skip specific directories or files)

Exclude by exact path:

```
~/.cache
~/Projects/node_modules
/tmp
```

**How they work**:
- Exact path matching
- Recursive: Excluding a directory skips everything inside it
- Supports `~` for home directory
- Case-sensitive on Linux

**Examples**:
- `~/Downloads/archives` - Skip your download archives subfolder
- `~/.local/share/Trash` - Skip trash (already in Home Folder default)
- `/var/cache` - Skip system cache (already in Full Scan default)

**2. Pattern Exclusions** (Skip files matching patterns)

Exclude by filename pattern using glob syntax:

```
*.tmp
*.log
*.iso
node_modules
```

**How they work**:
- Glob pattern matching (like shell wildcards)
- `*` matches any characters
- `?` matches a single character
- Applies to filenames, not full paths

**Common patterns**:
- `*.tmp` - Skip all temporary files
- `*.log` - Skip log files
- `*.iso` - Skip disk images (large and unlikely to be infected)
- `*.mp4` - Skip video files (for speed)
- `.DS_Store` - Skip macOS metadata files

#### Adding Exclusions to a Profile

**When creating or editing a profile**:

1. **In the Profile Dialog**:
   - Look for the **Exclusions** section

2. **Add Path Exclusion**:
   - Click **Add Exclusion Path**
   - A new row appears
   - Enter or browse to the path
   - Example: `~/Projects/node_modules`

3. **Add Pattern Exclusion**:
   - Click **Add Exclusion Pattern**
   - A new row appears
   - Enter the pattern
   - Example: `*.tmp`

4. **Remove an Exclusion**:
   - Click the **minus (-)** button next to the exclusion
   - The exclusion is removed immediately

**Exclusion Validation**:

ClamUI validates exclusions when you save:
- ✅ **Valid**: Accepted and saved
- ⚠️ **Warning**: Saved, but you'll see a warning (e.g., "This exclusion might exclude all targets")
- ❌ **Error**: Invalid format, must be corrected before saving

#### Global vs. Profile Exclusions

**Profile Exclusions** (Configured in each profile):
- Apply only when using that specific profile
- Different profiles can have different exclusions
- Stored with the profile

**Global Exclusions** (Configured in Preferences):
- Apply to ALL scans, regardless of profile
- Useful for system-wide exclusions you never want to scan
- Configured in Preferences → Exclusion Patterns
- See [Managing Exclusion Patterns](#managing-exclusion-patterns)

💡 **Tip**: Use global exclusions for system directories (`/proc`, `/sys`) and profile exclusions for profile-specific needs (skip videos in USB scanner profile, but not in Documents profile).

#### Exclusion Best Practices

**DO**:
- ✅ Exclude build artifacts and dependencies (`node_modules`, `vendor`, `build`)
- ✅ Skip virtual filesystems (`/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`)
- ✅ Exclude large media files if scanning for speed (`.iso`, `.mp4`)
- ✅ Skip caches and temporary directories
- ✅ Test your profile after adding exclusions

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Exclude your entire scan target (this creates a circular exclusion)
- ❌ Exclude important data folders like Documents or Downloads
- ❌ Blindly exclude common file types (.exe, .zip) - these can contain threats
- ❌ Over-exclude just to make scans faster - you might miss threats

**Example Exclusions by Use Case**:

| Use Case | Recommended Exclusions |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Development** | `*/node_modules`, `*/.git`, `*/build`, `*/dist`, `*/__pycache__` |
| **Media Library** | `*.mp4`, `*.mkv`, `*.avi`, `*.mp3`, `*.flac` (if just scanning for documents) |
| **USB Drives** | `*/lost+found`, `*.iso`, `System Volume Information` |
| **Home Directory** | `~/.cache`, `~/.local/share/Trash`, `~/Downloads/archives` |
| **System Scan** | `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, `/run`, `/tmp`, `/var/cache` |

### Importing and Exporting Profiles

Profiles can be exported to JSON files for backup, sharing, or transferring between computers.

#### Exporting a Profile

**Purpose**: Save a profile to a file

**Step-by-Step**:

1. **Open the Profile Manager**:
   - Hamburger menu → **Manage Profiles**

2. **Select the Profile**:
   - Find the profile you want to export
   - Click the **Export** button (download icon) next to it

3. **Choose Save Location**:
   - A file save dialog appears
   - Navigate to where you want to save the file
   - The filename defaults to `ProfileName.json`
   - Click **Save**

4. **Confirmation**:
   - The profile is exported to the JSON file
   - You'll see a success message

**What's in the export file?**

The JSON file contains:
- Profile name and description
- Target directories list
- Exclusion paths and patterns
- Metadata (creation date, update date)

**Example export file** (`Quick-Scan.json`):
```json
{
  "export_version": 1,
  "profile": {
    "name": "Quick Scan",
    "description": "Fast scan of the Downloads folder",
    "targets": ["~/Downloads"],
    "exclusions": {},
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Use cases for exporting**:
- **Backup**: Save your custom profiles before system reinstall
- **Sharing**: Send profiles to colleagues or friends
- **Version control**: Track changes to important scan configurations
- **Migration**: Move profiles to another computer

#### Importing a Profile

**Purpose**: Load a profile from a JSON file

**Step-by-Step**:

1. **Open the Profile Manager**:
   - Hamburger menu → **Manage Profiles**

2. **Click "Import Profile"**:
   - Look for the **Import** button (usually with an upload icon)
   - A file chooser dialog appears

3. **Select the JSON File**:
   - Navigate to your exported profile JSON file
   - Select the file (must have `.json` extension)
   - Click **Open**

4. **Handle Duplicate Names**:
   - If a profile with the same name already exists:
     - ClamUI automatically appends a number: `"Quick Scan (2)"`
     - The imported profile gets a new unique ID
     - Both profiles coexist independently

5. **Confirmation**:
   - You'll see a success message
   - The imported profile appears in your profile list immediately
   - It's available in the Scan Profile dropdown

**Import Validation**:

ClamUI validates imported profiles:
- ✅ Checks JSON syntax is valid
- ✅ Ensures required fields are present (name, targets)
- ✅ Validates paths and exclusions
- ❌ Rejects invalid files with error message

**Import Behavior**:

- **New ID**: Imported profiles always get a new unique ID
- **Never default**: Imported profiles are never marked as default (even if the export was from a default profile)
- **Name uniqueness**: Duplicate names get numeric suffix `(2)`, `(3)`, etc.
- **Editable**: Imported profiles can be edited or deleted

**Troubleshooting Import Errors**:

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Invalid JSON format" | File is corrupted or not JSON | Re-export the profile or check file contents |
| "Missing required field 'name'" | Export file is incomplete | Ensure file was exported correctly |
| "Invalid path format" | Paths in the file are malformed | Edit the JSON file to fix paths, or create a new profile |
| "File not found" | JSON file path is incorrect | Verify file location and try again |

#### Sharing Profiles

**Best practices for sharing**:

1. **Export to a descriptive filename**:
   - Good: `USB-Scanner-Profile.json`
   - Bad: `profile.json`

2. **Include documentation**:
   - Add a README explaining what the profile does
   - Note any system-specific paths that might need adjustment

3. **Test on target system**:
   - Import the profile on the destination computer
   - Run a scan to verify it works as expected
   - Adjust paths if needed (e.g., `/media/usb` vs `/mnt/usb`)

4. **Version your profiles**:
   - Include version or date in filename: `Dev-Scan-v2-2024-01.json`
   - Keep older versions as backups

**Privacy note**: Exported profiles contain paths from your system, which might reveal usernames or directory structures. Review the JSON file before sharing publicly.

### Managing Profiles

#### Viewing All Profiles

**In the Profile Manager** (Hamburger menu → Manage Profiles):

You'll see a list of all profiles with:
- **Profile name** (e.g., "Quick Scan")
- **Description** (if provided)
- **Default badge** (for built-in profiles)
- **Action buttons**: Edit, Export, Delete

#### Deleting a Profile

**To remove a custom profile**:

1. Open the Profile Manager
2. Find the profile to delete
3. Click the **Delete** button (trash icon)
4. Confirm deletion in the dialog

**Important**:
- ❌ Default profiles cannot be deleted (Quick Scan, Full Scan, Home Folder)
- ✅ Custom profiles can be deleted freely
- ⚠️ Deletion is permanent (export first if you want to keep a backup)

#### Using Profiles in Scans

**From the Scan View**:

1. **Select a profile**:
   - Click the **Scan Profile** dropdown
   - Choose a profile from the list
   - The target path updates automatically

2. **Start scanning**:
   - Click the **Scan** button
   - The scan uses the profile's targets and exclusions

3. **Switch back to manual**:
   - Select **No Profile (Manual)** from the dropdown
   - You can now manually select paths with Browse button

**Profile indicator**:
- When a profile is selected, the dropdown shows the profile name
- The "Selected Path" row shows the first target (or "Multiple locations" if the profile has multiple targets)

#### Profile Tips and Tricks

💡 **Productivity Tips**:

1. **Create profiles for recurring tasks**:
   - Weekly home scan: "Weekly Home Check"
   - After downloads: "Post-Download Quick Scan"
   - Before backup: "Pre-Backup Full Scan"

2. **Name profiles by frequency or purpose**:
   - "Daily Downloads Check"
   - "Monthly System Scan"
   - "USB Drive Inspector"

3. **Use exclusions strategically**:
   - Development scans: Exclude `node_modules`, `.git`, build folders
   - Media scans: Exclude video files if you only care about documents
   - System scans: Exclude virtual filesystems and caches

4. **Combine with scheduled scans**:
   - Create a profile
   - Use it in scheduled scans for automated security
   - See [Scheduled Scans](#scheduled-scans)

5. **Keep profiles updated**:
   - As your directory structure changes, update profile targets
   - Add new exclusions as you discover slowdowns
   - Delete unused profiles to reduce clutter

## Quarantine Management

When ClamUI detects a threat, you can **quarantine** the file - a safe isolation process that prevents the threat from causing harm while giving you options to review, restore, or delete it permanently.

### What is Quarantine?

**Quarantine** is a secure storage area where detected threats are isolated from your system. Think of it as a digital "holding cell" for suspicious files.

#### How Quarantine Works

When you quarantine a file, ClamUI:

1. **Moves the file** from its original location to a secure quarantine directory
2. **Records metadata** in a database (original path, threat name, detection date, file size, hash)
3. **Calculates a hash** (SHA-256) to verify file integrity
4. **Stores it safely** where it cannot execute or spread

**Important facts about quarantine**:

- ✅ **Safe**: Quarantined files cannot run or infect your system
- ✅ **Reversible**: You can restore files if they're false positives
- ✅ **Verifiable**: File integrity is checked before restoration
- ✅ **Automatic cleanup**: Old items can be cleared after 30 days
- ✅ **Detailed records**: Full metadata preserved for each file

#### When to Use Quarantine

**Quarantine immediately for**:
- 🔴 **CRITICAL** threats (ransomware, rootkits)
- 🟠 **HIGH** threats (trojans, worms, backdoors)
- 🟡 **MEDIUM** threats (adware, PUA, spyware) - investigate first

**Consider before quarantining**:
- 🔵 **LOW** threats (EICAR tests, heuristic detections) - likely false positives
- **Known safe files**: Software tools, security utilities, test files
- **Development files**: Build tools, compilers that trigger PUA detections

💡 **Tip**: If you're unsure whether a detection is legitimate, research the threat name online or quarantine it temporarily while you investigate.

### Viewing Quarantined Files

Access your quarantined files through the **Quarantine view** to review isolated threats and manage them.

#### Opening the Quarantine View

**From the main window**:
1. Click the **Quarantine** button in the left navigation sidebar
2. The quarantine list loads automatically

**Keyboard shortcut**: No dedicated shortcut, but navigate using Tab or arrow keys.

#### Understanding the Quarantine List

The quarantine list shows all isolated files with key information:

### Restoring Files from Quarantine

If a quarantined file is actually safe (a **false positive**), you can restore it to its original location.

⚠️ **Important**: Only restore files you are **absolutely certain** are safe. If you're unsure, leave the file quarantined or delete it.

#### When to Restore Files

**Restore if**:
- ✅ You recognize the file as legitimate software
- ✅ The threat is flagged as **LOW** severity (often EICAR tests or heuristics)
- ✅ You verified the file source and it's from a trusted developer
- ✅ You researched the threat name and confirmed it's a known false positive
- ✅ You need the file for work and have verified its safety

**Do NOT restore if**:
- ❌ The threat is **CRITICAL** or **HIGH** severity
- ❌ You don't recognize the file or don't remember downloading it
- ❌ The file came from an untrusted source (unknown website, email attachment)
- ❌ You cannot verify the file is safe
- ❌ The detection is for ransomware, trojan, or malware

#### How to Restore a File

**Step-by-Step**:

1. **Open Quarantine View**:
   - Navigate to the **Quarantine** view

2. **Find the File**:
   - Locate the quarantined file in the list
   - Check the threat name and original path

3. **Expand the Entry**:
   - Click the file entry to expand it
   - Review the full details (path, date, size)

4. **Click Restore**:
   - Click the **Restore** button (blue button)
   - A confirmation dialog appears

5. **Review the Warning**:
   ```
   Restore File?

   This will restore the file to its original location:
   /home/user/Downloads/suspicious.exe

   Warning: This file was detected as a threat (Win.Trojan.Generic-12345).
   Only restore if you are certain it is a false positive.

   [Cancel]  [Restore]
   ```

6. **Confirm Restoration**:
   - Read the warning carefully
   - Verify the original path is correct
   - Click **Restore** to proceed, or **Cancel** to abort

7. **Wait for Completion**:
   - ClamUI verifies file integrity (checks SHA-256 hash)
   - Moves the file back to its original location
   - Removes the entry from quarantine
   - Shows success/failure message

**Success Message**:
```
✓ File restored successfully
```

**The file is now**:
- Back in its original location
- Removed from quarantine
- Can be used normally

#### Restore Errors

If restoration fails, you'll see an error message explaining why:

**Common Errors**:

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| **Cannot restore: A file already exists at the original location** | Another file now exists at the same path | Manually choose a different location for the file, or delete/move the existing file first |
| **File integrity verification failed** | The quarantined file was modified or corrupted | Do NOT restore - file may be damaged or tampered with. Delete it instead. |
| **Permission denied** | You don't have write access to the original directory | Run ClamUI with appropriate permissions, or manually move the file as root |
| **Quarantine entry not found** | The database entry is missing | The file may have been deleted. Refresh the quarantine list. |
| **File not found** | The quarantined file was manually deleted from storage | The file is gone. Remove the database entry by clicking Delete. |

💡 **Troubleshooting Tip**: If you need the file but restoration fails, you can find it manually in the quarantine storage directory (see [Understanding Quarantine Storage](#understanding-quarantine-storage)) and copy it yourself.

#### After Restoring

Once a file is restored:

1. **Rescan it**: Run a scan on the restored file to verify it's still detected
   - If ClamAV still flags it → likely a real threat, quarantine again
   - If ClamAV doesn't flag it → may have been a false positive

2. **Add an exclusion** (if it's a known false positive):
   - Go to **Preferences** → **Exclusion Patterns**
   - Add the file path or a pattern to prevent future detections
   - See [Managing Exclusion Patterns](#managing-exclusion-patterns)

3. **Report false positives** (optional):
   - Visit the ClamAV false positive reporting page
   - Help improve ClamAV's detection accuracy
   - [https://www.clamav.net/reports/fp](https://www.clamav.net/reports/fp)

### Permanently Deleting Threats

If a quarantined file is genuinely malicious, you should **permanently delete** it to free up storage and ensure it cannot be accidentally restored.

⚠️ **Warning**: Deletion is **permanent and irreversible**. Once deleted, the file cannot be recovered.

#### When to Delete Files

**Delete immediately for**:
- 🔴 **CRITICAL** threats (ransomware, rootkits, bootkits)
- 🟠 **HIGH** threats (trojans, worms, backdoors) - after you're sure they're not false positives
- Known malware that you've verified is not a false positive

**Consider keeping quarantined (don't delete yet) if**:
- You're not 100% certain the file is malicious
- You want to investigate further
- The threat is **LOW** severity and might be a false positive
- You need time to verify with antivirus vendors or security forums

💡 **Best Practice**: When in doubt, keep files quarantined for a few days/weeks while you research. You can delete them later using the "Clear Old Items" feature.

#### How to Delete a File

**Step-by-Step**:

1. **Open Quarantine View**:
   - Navigate to the **Quarantine** view

2. **Find the File**:
   - Locate the quarantined threat in the list
   - Verify the threat name and path

3. **Expand the Entry**:
   - Click the file entry to expand it
   - Double-check you're deleting the right file

4. **Click Delete**:
   - Click the **Delete** button (red button)
   - A confirmation dialog appears

5. **Review the Warning**:
   ```
   Permanently Delete File?

   This will permanently delete the quarantined file:

   Threat: Win.Trojan.Generic-12345
   Size: 1.2 MB

   This action cannot be undone.

   [Cancel]  [Delete]
   ```

6. **Confirm Deletion**:
   - Verify the threat name and size
   - Click **Delete** to proceed, or **Cancel** to abort
   - **There is no undo** - be certain before confirming

7. **Wait for Completion**:
   - ClamUI deletes the file from quarantine storage
   - Removes the database entry
   - Shows success/failure message

**Success Message**:
```
✓ File deleted permanently
```

**The file is now**:
- Permanently deleted from quarantine storage
- Removed from the quarantine database
- Cannot be recovered

#### Delete Errors

If deletion fails, you'll see an error message:

**Common Errors**:

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| **Permission denied** | ClamUI doesn't have permission to delete the file | Check quarantine directory permissions. May need to run as different user. |
| **File not found** | File was already deleted manually | Click Refresh to update the list. The entry will be cleaned up. |
| **Quarantine entry not found** | Database entry is missing | Refresh the list. The file may have already been removed. |

💡 **Tip**: If deletion fails, you can manually delete files from the quarantine storage directory. See [Understanding Quarantine Storage](#understanding-quarantine-storage).

### Clearing Old Quarantine Items

Over time, quarantined files accumulate and use disk space. ClamUI provides a **Clear Old Items** feature to automatically remove files older than 30 days.

#### Why Clear Old Items?

**Benefits**:
- 🗑️ **Free up disk space**: Remove old threats you've forgotten about
- 🧹 **Reduce clutter**: Keep the quarantine list focused on recent detections
- ⏰ **Automatic cleanup**: Don't manually review old files one by one
- 🔒 **Safe timeframe**: 30 days is enough time to verify false positives

**When to use it**:
- After several months of use when quarantine is filling up
- When you notice quarantine storage is taking significant space
- As part of regular system maintenance (monthly/quarterly)
- When you're confident old detections are genuine threats

#### How to Clear Old Items

**Step-by-Step**:

1. **Open Quarantine View**:
   - Navigate to the **Quarantine** view

2. **Click "Clear Old Items"**:
   - Look for the **Clear Old Items** button in the header
   - Located near the Refresh button (top right of quarantine list)

3. **Review the Confirmation Dialog**:
   ```
   Clear Old Items?

   This will permanently delete 8 quarantined file(s) that are older than 30 days.

   This action cannot be undone.

   [Cancel]  [Clear Old Items]
   ```

4. **Check the Count**:
   - The dialog shows how many files will be deleted
   - Make sure the number seems reasonable
   - If it's higher than expected, consider reviewing the list first

5. **Confirm Cleanup**:
   - Click **Clear Old Items** to proceed
   - Click **Cancel** if you want to review files individually first

6. **Wait for Completion**:
   - ClamUI deletes all files older than 30 days
   - Removes database entries
   - Shows success message with count

**Success Message**:
```
✓ Removed 8 old item(s)
```

**If no old items exist**:
```
ℹ No items older than 30 days
```

#### What Gets Cleared

**Files included**:
- ✅ Any file quarantined **more than 30 days ago** (based on detection date)
- ✅ All threat types (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- ✅ All file sizes

**Files excluded**:
- ❌ Files quarantined **less than 30 days ago** (kept in quarantine)
- ❌ Files you've just added this month

**Age calculation**:
- Based on the **Detection Date** field
- Calculated from current date/time
- Exactly 30 days = 30 × 24 hours from detection timestamp

💡 **Example**: If today is February 15, 2024:
- File from January 15, 2024 → Cleared (30 days old)
- File from January 16, 2024 → Kept (29 days old)
- File from February 1, 2024 → Kept (14 days old)

#### Before Clearing: Review the List

**Recommended workflow**:

1. **Sort by age** (mentally):
   - Scroll through the quarantine list
   - Older entries appear with earlier detection dates
   - Identify files from >30 days ago

2. **Check for false positives**:
   - Look for **LOW** severity threats in old entries
   - Review any files you recognize as safe
   - Restore false positives before clearing

3. **Verify critical threats**:
   - Confirm CRITICAL/HIGH threats are genuine malware
   - Research any unfamiliar threat names
   - Decide if you want to keep them longer for reference

4. **Then clear**:
   - Once you're satisfied, run "Clear Old Items"
   - Old threats are removed automatically

⚠️ **Warning**: The 30-day threshold is **fixed** and cannot be customized in the current version. If you want to keep files longer, don't use this feature - delete files individually instead.

### Understanding Quarantine Storage

Quarantined files are stored securely on your system. Understanding where and how they're stored helps with troubleshooting and advanced management.

#### Storage Location

**Default Quarantine Directory**:
```
~/.local/share/clamui/quarantine/
```

**Full path example**:
```
/home/username/.local/share/clamui/quarantine/
```

**What this means**:
- `~` = Your home directory
- `.local/share/` = User-specific application data (XDG Base Directory standard)
- `clamui/` = ClamUI's data directory
- `quarantine/` = Isolated threat storage

**Database Location**:
```
~/.local/share/clamui/quarantine.db
```

This SQLite database stores metadata for each quarantined file:
- Original file path
- Quarantine storage path
- Threat name
- Detection date/time
- File size
- SHA-256 hash (for integrity verification)

#### How Files Are Stored

When you quarantine a file, ClamUI:

1. **Generates a unique filename**:
   - Uses timestamp + random identifier
   - Example: `quarantined_20240115_143022_a3f9d8e1`
   - Original filename is NOT preserved in storage

2. **Moves the file**:
   - From original location (e.g., `/home/user/Downloads/virus.exe`)
   - To quarantine directory (e.g., `~/.local/share/clamui/quarantine/quarantined_20240115_143022_a3f9d8e1`)

3. **Calculates SHA-256 hash**:
   - Creates a cryptographic fingerprint of the file
   - Stored in database for integrity verification
   - Used to detect tampering before restoration

4. **Records metadata**:
   - All information saved to `quarantine.db`
   - Links the quarantined file to its original path

**Example quarantine storage**:
```
~/.local/share/clamui/
├── quarantine/
│   ├── quarantined_20240115_143022_a3f9d8e1   (Win.Trojan.Generic)
│   ├── quarantined_20240110_091530_b7e4f2c9   (PUA.Linux.Miner)
│   └── quarantined_20240105_182045_c1d8a3f7   (Eicar-Test-Signature)
└── quarantine.db                               (Metadata database)
```

#### File Permissions

**Security measures**:
- Quarantine directory has restricted permissions (user-only access)
- Files cannot execute from quarantine (standard file permissions)
- No special attributes needed - isolation is through location and database tracking

**Default permissions**:
- Directory: `700` (rwx------, owner read/write/execute only)
- Files: Preserve original permissions but cannot execute from this location

#### Storage Considerations

**Disk Space Usage**:
- Quarantined files consume disk space equal to their original size
- Large files (ISOs, videos) take significant space
- Monitor with: **Total Size** in quarantine view header
- Example: 50 quarantined files = ~100 MB (varies widely)

**Quota Limits**:
- No built-in quota limit
- Quarantine can grow indefinitely if not cleared
- Use "Clear Old Items" regularly to manage space
- Consider manual cleanup if storage is constrained

**Best Practices for Storage Management**:

💡 **Tips**:

1. **Regular cleanup**:
   - Use "Clear Old Items" monthly or quarterly
   - Delete confirmed threats after a few days/weeks
   - Don't keep EICAR test files in quarantine

2. **Monitor storage**:
   - Check "Total Size" indicator in Quarantine view
   - If it exceeds 500 MB, review and delete old files
   - Large quarantine may slow down list loading

3. **Delete large false positives**:
   - If you restore a large file (e.g., 100+ MB ISO)
   - It's removed from quarantine automatically
   - But if you delete without restoring, it frees space immediately

4. **Backup considerations**:
   - Do NOT include `~/.local/share/clamui/quarantine/` in backups
   - These are isolated threats - you don't want to back them up
   - The database (`quarantine.db`) can be backed up safely (only metadata)

#### Manual File Management

**Advanced users** can manually manage quarantine files:

**Viewing files**:
```bash
ls -lh ~/.local/share/clamui/quarantine/
```

**Checking storage size**:
```bash
du -sh ~/.local/share/clamui/quarantine/
```

**Manually deleting all quarantined files** (⚠️ use with caution):
```bash
rm -rf ~/.local/share/clamui/quarantine/*
rm ~/.local/share/clamui/quarantine.db
```

**Restoring a file manually** (if ClamUI fails):
```bash
# Find the original path in the database first, then:
cp ~/.local/share/clamui/quarantine/quarantined_XXXXXX /original/path/filename
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Manual management bypasses integrity checks and database updates. Only use if ClamUI's built-in features aren't working.

#### Flatpak Considerations

If you installed ClamUI via **Flatpak**, the quarantine location is different:

**Flatpak Quarantine Directory**:
```
~/.var/app/io.github.dave-kennedy.ClamUI/data/clamui/quarantine/
```

**Flatpak Database**:
```
~/.var/app/io.github.dave-kennedy.ClamUI/data/clamui/quarantine.db
```

**Accessing Flatpak quarantine**:
- Same directory structure, just different base path
- All ClamUI features work identically
- Manual file operations require Flatpak-specific paths

💡 **Tip**: You can check if you're using Flatpak by running:
```bash
flatpak list | grep -i clamui
```

If output appears, you're using the Flatpak version.

#### Troubleshooting Storage Issues

**Problem: Quarantine list shows files but directory is empty**

**Cause**: Database entries exist but files were manually deleted

**Solution**:
1. Click each entry and click **Delete** to clean up database entries
2. Or manually delete the database file (⚠️ removes all quarantine records):
   ```bash
   rm ~/.local/share/clamui/quarantine.db
   ```

**Problem: File restoration fails with "File integrity verification failed"**

**Cause**: The quarantined file was modified or corrupted in storage

**Solution**:
- Do NOT restore this file - it may be damaged or tampered with
- Delete the entry permanently
- If you need the file, obtain it from the original source again

**Problem: Quarantine view loads slowly**

**Cause**: Too many entries in the database (hundreds or thousands)

**Solution**:
1. Use "Clear Old Items" to reduce count
2. Delete old entries manually
3. Consider clearing the entire quarantine if all files are confirmed threats

**Problem: Permission denied when quarantining/restoring/deleting**

**Cause**: Incorrect file permissions on quarantine directory

**Solution**:
```bash
# Fix quarantine directory permissions:
chmod 700 ~/.local/share/clamui/quarantine/
chmod 644 ~/.local/share/clamui/quarantine.db
```

## Scan History

ClamUI keeps a detailed history of all your scans and virus definition updates. This allows you to review past operations, check when you last scanned specific folders, and investigate previous threat detections.

### Viewing Past Scan Results

#### Opening the Scan History View

To access your scan history:

1. Click the **"Logs"** navigation button in the sidebar (document icon)
2. The view opens with two tabs:
   - **Historical Logs** - Past scan and update operations (default)
   - **ClamAV Daemon** - Live logs from the clamd daemon (advanced users)

Make sure you're on the **Historical Logs** tab to view past scans.

#### Understanding the Historical Logs List

The logs list shows all your past operations, with the newest entries at the top:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Historical Logs                    [spinner] [↻] [Clear All]   │

### Filtering Scan History

ClamUI automatically sorts your scan history by date, showing the **newest entries first**. This ensures you always see your most recent scans at the top of the list.

#### Current Filtering Behavior

**Automatic Date Sorting:**

- Logs are sorted by timestamp in descending order (newest to oldest)
- The most recent scan or update always appears at the top
- No manual date filtering is currently available

**Viewing Older Logs:**

Use the pagination buttons to navigate through your history:

1. **Initial view**: Shows your 25 most recent operations
2. **Show More**: Loads the next 25 older entries
3. **Show All**: Displays all historical logs

#### Identifying Log Types

While there's no filter dropdown, you can easily identify log types by their icons:

- **📁 Folder icon** = Scan operation
- **🔄 Update icon** = Virus definition update

#### Finding Specific Scans

To find a particular scan in your history:

1. Look for the **path** in the subtitle (e.g., ".../Downloads")
2. Check the **timestamp** to narrow down by date
3. Check the **status indicator**:
   - ✅ Green checkmark = Clean scan or successful update
   - ⚠️ Warning symbol = Infected scan or error

**Example search workflow:**

> "I want to find when I last scanned my Documents folder for threats..."

1. Scan the list for entries showing ".../Documents" in the subtitle
2. Look for entries with ⚠️ warning indicators (infections)
3. Click the entry to view full details including threat names

💡 **Tip**: If you have many logs, use **Show All** to load everything, then use your browser's find feature (Ctrl+F) to search through the visible entries.

---

### Understanding Log Entries

#### Log Entry Structure

Every log entry contains both **summary information** (visible in the list) and **detailed information** (shown when selected).

**Summary Information** (Always Visible):

| **Path** | Complete file path | Scan operations only |
| **Duration** | Operation time (seconds) | Always (0.00 if unavailable) |
| **Summary** | Human-readable description | Always |
| **Full Output** | Complete details and raw output | Always |

#### Status Meanings

**Scan Statuses:**

- **`clean`** - ✅ No threats detected
  - All scanned files are safe
  - Example: "Clean scan of /home/user/Downloads"

- **`infected`** - ⚠️ Threats found and logged
  - One or more threats detected
  - View details to see threat list
  - Example: "Found 2 threat(s) in /home/user/Documents"

- **`error`** - ⚠️ Scan failed to complete
  - Could be permission denied, path not found, or ClamAV error
  - Check Full Output for error message
  - Example: "Scan error: /mnt/external"

- **`cancelled`** - ℹ️ User stopped the scan
  - You clicked "Cancel" during scanning
  - Partial results may be available

**Update Statuses:**

- **`success`** - ✅ Database update completed
  - New virus definitions downloaded and installed
  - Example: "Virus database update completed"

- **`up_to_date`** - ✅ Already have latest definitions
  - No update needed
  - Example: "Virus definitions are up to date"

- **`error`** - ⚠️ Update failed
  - Could be network issue, permission denied, or service unavailable
  - Check Full Output for error details

#### Interpreting Full Output

When you select a log entry, the **Full Output** section shows operation-specific details.

**For Clean Scans:**

```
Scanned: 1,234 files, 45 directories
```

- **Files**: Number of individual files checked
- **Directories**: Number of folders traversed
- No threat details (scan was clean)

**For Infected Scans:**

```
Scanned: 567 files, 12 directories
Threats found: 2
  - /home/user/Documents/suspicious.exe: Win.Trojan.Generic-1234
  - /home/user/Downloads/test.pdf: Pdf.Exploit.CVE-2023-12345
```

- Shows file and directory counts
- Lists threat count
- Provides detailed threat information:
  - **Full file path** where threat was found
  - **Threat name** as identified by ClamAV

**For Errors:**

```
Error: Permission denied scanning /root/private
```

or

```
Error: Path not found: /mnt/external/backup
```

- Shows the specific error message
- Helps diagnose why the scan failed

**For Updates:**

```
Database updated successfully
Updated from version 26523 to 26524
```

or simply:

```
Virus definitions are already up to date (version 26524)
```

#### Scheduled vs Manual Scans

Log entries include a hidden `scheduled` flag indicating whether the scan was automatic:

- **Manual scans**: You started them through the UI or command line
- **Scheduled scans**: Automatically run by systemd timer or cron

Currently, both types appear the same in the UI. You can infer scheduled scans by:
- Consistent timestamps (e.g., every day at 9:00 AM)
- Scanning common profile targets (Downloads, Home Folder, Full System)

#### Exporting to Text File

To save a log entry as a text file:

1. **Select a log entry** from the list
2. Click the **Export to Text** button (💾 icon)
3. A file save dialog appears
4. **Choose a location** and optionally rename the file
   - Default name: `clamui_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`
   - Example: `clamui_log_20240115_143045.txt`
5. Click **Save**
6. A toast notification confirms: "Log exported to clamui_log_20240115_143045.txt"

**Text File Format:**

The exported `.txt` file contains exactly the same content as the clipboard export:
- Plain text format
- UTF-8 encoding
- Readable in any text editor
- Same structure as displayed in the UI

**Use Cases:**

- Archiving scan results for compliance
- Creating scan reports for documentation
- Sharing with users who need human-readable format

**Export Error Handling:**

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Permission denied" | Cannot write to selected location | Choose a location you have write access to (e.g., Documents, Downloads) |
| "Invalid file path selected" | Selected a remote/network location | Select a local folder on your computer |
| File dialog closes with no message | Cancelled by clicking "Cancel" | Normal behavior, try again |

#### Exporting to CSV File

To save a log entry as a CSV file:

1. **Select a log entry** from the list
2. Click the **Export to CSV** button (📊 icon)
3. A file save dialog appears
4. **Choose a location** and optionally rename the file
   - Default name: `clamui_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
   - Example: `clamui_log_20240115_143045.csv`
5. Click **Save**
6. A toast notification confirms: "Log exported to clamui_log_20240115_143045.csv"

**CSV File Format:**

The exported CSV file contains a header row and one data row:

| timestamp | type | status | path | summary | duration |
|-----------|------|--------|------|---------|----------|
| 2024-01-15T14:30:45.123456 | scan | clean | /home/user/Downloads | Clean scan of /home/user/Downloads | 12.34 |

**CSV Characteristics:**

- Standard RFC 4180 CSV format
- UTF-8 encoding
- Proper quoting for fields containing commas
- Opens in Excel, LibreOffice Calc, Google Sheets
- Easy to import into databases or analysis tools

**Use Cases:**

- Importing into spreadsheet software for analysis
- Creating scan history reports with charts
- Bulk processing scan data with scripts
- Compliance reporting requiring structured data

💡 **Tip**: To create a comprehensive scan history CSV with all your logs, you'll need to export each entry individually and then combine them. The CSV format makes this easy - just copy the data rows (excluding headers) and paste into a master spreadsheet.

#### Exporting Multiple Logs

**Current Limitation:**

ClamUI currently exports one log entry at a time. There's no "Export All" button.

**Workaround for Bulk Export:**

If you need all your scan history:

1. Locate the log storage directory:
   - Default: `~/.local/share/clamui/logs/`
   - Flatpak: `~/.var/app/com.github.davesteele.ClamUI/data/clamui/logs/` (if applicable)
2. **Copy the entire directory** to your desired backup location
3. Each log is stored as `<UUID>.json` (e.g., `7a3b9f12-4e56-7890-abcd-ef1234567890.json`)
4. Use a script or JSON tools to process these files if needed

**Manual JSON Processing Example:**

```bash
# List all log files
ls ~/.local/share/clamui/logs/

# View a specific log
cat ~/.local/share/clamui/logs/7a3b9f12-4e56-7890-abcd-ef1234567890.json | jq

# Count total logs
ls ~/.local/share/clamui/logs/*.json | wc -l
```

### Viewing Daemon Logs (Advanced)

The **ClamAV Daemon** tab shows live logs from the clamd background service. This is useful for troubleshooting daemon-related issues or monitoring real-time activity.

#### Opening Daemon Logs

1. Navigate to **Logs** view
2. Click the **ClamAV Daemon** tab at the top
3. The daemon status and log viewer appear

#### Understanding Daemon Status

The status row shows clamd's current state:

**🟢 Running:**
- Daemon is active and ready to scan
- Live log updates available
- Example: "Daemon Status: Running"

**⚪ Stopped:**
- Daemon is installed but not running
- Start it with: `sudo systemctl start clamav-daemon`
- Live logs unavailable

**ℹ️ Not installed:**
- clamd package not detected
- ClamUI can still scan using `clamscan` command
- Helpful message explains daemon is optional

**❓ Unknown:**
- Unable to determine daemon status
- May indicate permission issues or system configuration

#### Using Live Log Updates

To view real-time daemon logs:

1. Ensure daemon status shows **"Running"**
2. Click the **Play button** (▶️) to start live updates
   - Button changes to ⏸️ (pause icon)
   - Tooltip changes to "Stop live log updates"
3. Logs refresh automatically every 3 seconds
4. Scroll automatically jumps to newest entries
5. Click **Pause** (⏸️) to stop auto-refresh

**What You'll See:**

```
Mon Jan 15 14:30:01 2024 -> +++ Started at Mon Jan 15 14:30:01 2024
Mon Jan 15 14:30:01 2024 -> clamd daemon 1.0.0 (OS: linux-gnu, ARCH: x86_64)
Mon Jan 15 14:30:01 2024 -> Log file size limit disabled.
Mon Jan 15 14:30:01 2024 -> Reading databases from /var/lib/clamav
Mon Jan 15 14:30:03 2024 -> Database correctly loaded (7654321 signatures)
Mon Jan 15 14:30:03 2024 -> TCP: Bound to address [::]:3310
Mon Jan 15 14:30:03 2024 -> Running as user clamav (UID 108, GID 113)
Mon Jan 15 14:35:12 2024 -> /home/user/Downloads/file.txt: OK
```

**Log Entry Types:**

- **Startup messages**: Daemon initialization, database loading
- **Scan results**: Files scanned via daemon (`OK`, `FOUND`)
- **Database updates**: When freshclam updates definitions
- **Connection events**: Client connections and disconnections
- **Errors**: Permission issues, configuration problems

#### Viewing in Fullscreen

For easier reading of long daemon logs:

1. Click the **Fullscreen button** (⛶ icon) in the Daemon Logs header
2. A fullscreen dialog opens with the complete log content
3. Read and scroll comfortably in the expanded view
4. **Close** or press **Escape** to return

💡 **Tip**: Use fullscreen mode when diagnosing daemon issues or copying large portions of logs for support tickets.

#### Troubleshooting Daemon Log Access

**"Permission denied" errors:**

If you see permission errors reading `/var/log/clamav/clamd.log`:

```
Permission denied reading /var/log/clamav/clamd.log

The daemon log file requires elevated permissions.
Options:
  • Add your user to the 'adm' or 'clamav' group:
    sudo usermod -aG adm $USER
  • Or check if clamd logs to systemd journal:
    journalctl -u clamav-daemon
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Add yourself to the log-reading group:**
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG adm $USER
   ```
   Then log out and back in for changes to take effect.

2. **Use journalctl instead** (if clamd uses systemd):
   ```bash
   journalctl -u clamav-daemon -n 100 --no-pager
   ```

3. **Check if clamd is actually running:**
   ```bash
   systemctl status clamav-daemon
   ```

**"Daemon log file not found" errors:**

ClamUI checks these locations automatically:
- `/var/log/clamav/clamd.log`
- `/var/log/clamd.log`
- Log path from `/etc/clamav/clamd.conf`

If none exist, clamd may not be installed or may log to journalctl instead.

### Managing Your Log History

#### Clearing Old Logs

Over time, your log history can grow large. Clear old logs to free up disk space:

1. Navigate to **Logs** view → **Historical Logs** tab
2. Click **Clear All** button in the top-right
3. A confirmation dialog appears:
   ```
   Clear All Logs?

   This will permanently delete all historical logs.
   This action cannot be undone.

   [Cancel]  [Clear All]
   ```
4. Click **Clear All** to confirm (button is red/destructive)
5. All log entries are deleted immediately
6. The empty state appears: "No logs yet"

⚠️ **Warning**: This action is permanent and cannot be undone. Export important logs before clearing.

💡 **Tip**: If you want to preserve certain logs, export them to text or CSV files before clearing.

#### Log Storage Location

Logs are stored as individual JSON files on your system:

**Default Installation:**
```
~/.local/share/clamui/logs/
├── 7a3b9f12-4e56-7890-abcd-ef1234567890.json
├── b2c4d5e6-f789-0123-4567-89abcdef0123.json
└── ... (one file per log entry)
```

**Flatpak Installation** (if applicable):
```
~/.var/app/com.github.davesteele.ClamUI/data/clamui/logs/
```

**Storage Considerations:**

- Each log entry is typically 500 bytes to 2 KB
- 1,000 logs ≈ 1-2 MB of disk space
- JSON format is human-readable if you open files directly
- Files are named by UUID (matches the ID field in log details)

**Manual Log Management:**

For advanced users, you can manage logs directly:

```bash
# View log count
ls ~/.local/share/clamui/logs/*.json | wc -l

# Check storage usage
du -sh ~/.local/share/clamui/logs/

# Backup all logs
cp -r ~/.local/share/clamui/logs/ ~/clamui-logs-backup/

# Delete logs older than 30 days
find ~/.local/share/clamui/logs/ -name "*.json" -mtime +30 -delete

# View a specific log file
cat ~/.local/share/clamui/logs/<UUID>.json | jq
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Manually deleting log files bypasses the UI's "Clear All" confirmation dialog. Be certain before running manual deletion commands.

---

### Log History Best Practices

**Regular Review:**

- Check logs weekly to ensure scans are running as expected
- Verify scheduled scans are completing successfully
- Investigate any recurring errors

**Export Important Findings:**

- Export logs showing threat detections for your records
- Save CSV exports for monthly/quarterly security reports
- Keep text exports when reporting false positives to ClamAV

**Periodic Cleanup:**

- Clear very old logs (6+ months) if you don't need historical data
- Or export to backup before clearing to free up space
- Consider disk space if you perform many scans daily

**Compliance and Auditing:**

- Use log exports to demonstrate regular antivirus scanning
- CSV format makes it easy to generate scan frequency reports
- Logs include precise timestamps for audit trails

**Troubleshooting:**

- Check logs when scans fail to understand what went wrong
- Compare clean vs infected scan outputs to identify patterns
- Use daemon logs to diagnose clamd connection issues

💡 **Tip**: Set a monthly reminder to review your scan history and export any logs you need to keep before clearing the rest.
