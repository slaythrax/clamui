# ClamUI SQLite Connection Pool Module
"""
SQLite connection pool for the quarantine database.

Manages a pool of SQLite connections to reduce connection overhead for
batch operations and UI updates that make multiple quick queries.

Security Considerations:
    This module applies the same security hardening as QuarantineDatabase, setting
    restrictive 0o600 permissions on database files to prevent unauthorized access
    to sensitive quarantine metadata (file paths, threat names, SHA-256 hashes) by
    other users on multi-user systems.

        SQLite's Write-Ahead Logging mode. All files are set to 0o600 (owner read/write only)
        to prevent other users from reading sensitive quarantine metadata.

        Security Rationale:
            On multi-user systems, the quarantine database is a valuable information source
            for attackers. It reveals:
            - Which files were detected as threats (threat intelligence)
            - Original file locations (system reconnaissance)
            - File hashes for potential malware recovery

        SQLite WAL Mode Files:
            - .db: Main database file containing all quarantine metadata
            - .db-wal: Write-Ahead Log file with uncommitted transactions
            - .db-shm: Shared Memory file for WAL mode coordination

            All three files can contain sensitive data and must be secured.

        Error Handling:
            Permission errors are handled gracefully without raising exceptions.
            This prevents database functionality from breaking on systems with:
            - Restrictive security policies (SELinux, AppArmor)
            - Immutable file attributes
            - Unusual filesystem configurations
