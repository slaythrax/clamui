# ClamUI Entry Point
"""
Main entry point for the ClamUI application.

This module provides the entry point for launching the ClamUI GTK4/Adwaita
desktop application. It handles path setup, CLI argument parsing for file
scanning, and initializes the GTK main loop.

Usage:
    python src/main.py
    python src/main.py /path/to/file.txt        # Scan a single file
    python src/main.py /path/to/folder          # Scan a folder
    python src/main.py file1.txt folder1 ...    # Scan multiple items

    (python src/main.py) while still supporting proper package imports.
